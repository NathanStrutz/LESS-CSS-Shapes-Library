Original CSS taken directly from The Shapes of CSS (http://css-tricks.com/examples/ShapesOfCSS/)

This is a mixin library for LESS CSS. Import this shapes mixin library to your LESS CSS files and you can create advanced shapes with a single HTML element and simplified LESS code that creates very fancy CSS tricks. All the shapes work with at least one browser.

LESS CSS gives this library the ability to let you customize each shape the way you want it, from size to color, sometimes more.
